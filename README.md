# Automata

A home automation system on Proteus using Arduino, a relay, a PIR sensor, and a temperature sensor. The system controls appliances by turning them on when the temperature exceeds 20Â°C and the PIR sensor detects a person's presence. This project emphasizes energy efficiency by ensuring appliances operate only when required.

Technologies Used: Proteus, Arduino, PIR Sensor, TMP36 Temperature Sensor, Relay Module.




## Key Features

- Automated Appliance Control: The system automatically turns appliances on or off based on the room's temperature and the detection of a person, ensuring efficient energy use.
- Energy Efficiency: By integrating temperature and presence detection, the system minimizes unnecessary energy consumption, operating appliances only when necessary.
- Real-Time Sensor Integration: Seamless integration of sensors in a simulated environment, providing real-time control and automation.
- Simulation-Driven Development: The entire system is developed and tested within Proteus, allowing for a robust and error-free design before physical implementation.
