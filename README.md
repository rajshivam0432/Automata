## Automata

A home automation system on Proteus using Arduino, a relay, a PIR sensor, and a temperature sensor. The system controls appliances by turning them on when the temperature exceeds 20Â°C and the PIR sensor detects a person's presence. This project emphasizes energy efficiency by ensuring appliances operate only when required.



# Technologies Used
- Proteus: Simulation environment for designing and testing the home automation system.
- Arduino: Microcontroller responsible for processing sensor data and controlling the relay.
- PIR Sensor: Detects the presence of a person in the room.
- LM35 Temperature Sensor: Monitors the ambient temperature.
- Relay Module: Acts as a switch to control the appliances based on sensor inputs.

# Key Features

- Automated Appliance Control: The system automatically turns appliances on or off based on the room's temperature and the detection of a person, ensuring efficient energy use.
- Energy Efficiency: By integrating temperature and presence detection, the system minimizes unnecessary energy consumption, operating appliances only when necessary.
- Real-Time Sensor Integration: Seamless integration of sensors in a simulated environment, providing real-time control and automation.
- Simulation-Driven Development: The entire system is developed and tested within Proteus, allowing for a robust and error-free design before physical implementation.
