# Automata

A home automation system on Proteus using Arduino, a relay, a PIR sensor, and a temperature sensor. The system controls appliances by turning them on when the temperature exceeds 20Â°C and the PIR sensor detects a person's presence. This project emphasizes energy efficiency by ensuring appliances operate only when required.

Technologies Used: Proteus, Arduino, PIR Sensor, TMP36 Temperature Sensor, Relay Module.




Key Features:
-Simulated automated appliance control based on temperature and presence detection.
-Focused on energy-efficient operation.
-Real-time sensor integration and control within a virtual environment.
